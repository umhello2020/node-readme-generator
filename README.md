## Description
    
This project is my first dive into back-end web developement, and it has been very interesting. This application uses Node.js to generate a README.md file with content based on user input via promts in the terminal. I hope this detailed README will help anyone else who is just starting back-end development, or a similar project, get started on their way.

## Visuals

Here are some simple visuals of what the process should look like after you have finished the prompts and what your finished README will look like without a preview.
    
## Installation
    
To use this application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your desktop. Once in your code editor of choice, you will need to open your terminal and initialize npm with the command: npm init. Once you have npm initialized, you will install npm with the command: npm install. To install inquirer, you will use the command: npm install inquirer@8.2.4, or whichever is the most recent version. That is all that you need to do in order to use this README generator.
            
## Usage
    
This project can be used to generate a README.md file with a prompted guideline for an easier experience creating a near perfect README. Once in your terminal you will type the command: node index.js. This command will begin the prompts to build your README, and once you have entered your input, you will simply hit enter to continue to the next question until you have finished the prompts. When you reach the prompt to choose your license, you will need to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to cycle through the choices, not your mouse. Once you have finished the prompts, your README will be created and should appear within your files. If you need to change anything you will be able to change the file as necessary, simply stage, commit, and push your changes once you have finished to solidify your generated README.
